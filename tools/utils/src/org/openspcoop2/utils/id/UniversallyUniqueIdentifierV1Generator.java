// Version 1: This generates a unique ID based on a network card MAC address and a timer. 
// These IDs are easy to predict (given one, I might be able to guess another one) and can be traced back to your network card. It's not recommended to create these.
//	UUIDv1 is NOT secure. It isn't meant to be. It is meant to be UNIQUE, not un-guessable. UUIDv1 uses the current timestamp, plus a machine identifier, 
//	plus some random-ish stuff to make a number that will never be generated by that algorithm again. 
//	This is appropriate for a transaction ID (even if everyone is doing millions of transactions/s).

	// Generators are fully thread-safe, so a single instance may be shared among multiple threads.
